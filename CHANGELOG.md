## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-29

### Added
- **`bin/harness.sh`** — the front-door CLI with three subcommands:
  - `version` — report the installed version (from `harness/harness.lock`, else
    `VERSION`) plus a best-effort latest published tag.
  - `update [--src DIR]` — checksum-guarded sync of the managed file set from
    upstream: refresh untouched files, **keep** user-edited ones and write the
    upstream copy beside them as `<file>.new`, add new files; never touches
    `docs/exec-plans/` or `.trace/`.
  - `release <x.y.z> [--dry-run] [--no-push] [--no-gh]` — gated bump + tag +
    GitHub release (semver + green-tests + clean-tree gates).
- **`VERSION`** file — canonical version, starting at `0.1.0`.
- **`harness/harness.lock`** — version + pristine upstream checksums of every
  managed file, written by `init.sh` (additive) and maintained by `update`.
- **`bin/_harness_lib.sh`** — shared helpers (managed-set enumeration, checksums,
  lockfile) used by both `harness.sh` and `init.sh`.
- **`release` skill** documenting the human-judgment side of cutting a release.
- TDD coverage for version/lock/update/release (`tests/run.sh`).
